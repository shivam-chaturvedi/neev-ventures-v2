Create a modern, bold, and purpose-driven website for Neev Ventures, a social enterprise focused on empowering rural women entrepreneurs.

The website should feel warm, confident, contemporary, and impact-focused.
Balance softness and strength — human, inclusive, and mission-led, but not delicate or minimal.
Design should feel like a new-age NGO + startup hybrid.

Name and tagline- Neev Ventures- from our villages, for our future

 

Our mission- In every village, there are women with powerful ideas: ideas that remain unseen because they lack the right support. Neev Ventures exists to change the story. Our mission is to help rural women unlock this hidden potential by giving them access to financial tools, hands-on product skills, and entrepreneurial pathways. We work closely with SHGs to turn everyday materials into sustainable products and to connect them to real markets, both online and offline. We believe that empowerment is not charity:  it is the power to create, own, and lead.




Products with a purpose- Will add this section later as products and prices are not finalized as of yet. Blank ready to fill product slots can be created till then




Our model-




Economics- We start by listening. Every community is unique, and every SHG has its own strengths. So we sit with the women, understand their daily lives, their income needs, and the raw materials around them. From there, we work with them to create beautiful, sustainable products such as holi colours, candles, incense, and much more. This pillar isn’t just about income. It’s about showing women that their skills, their hands, and their resources already hold immense value.




Financial Literacy- For many rural women, the world of banking and digital finance can feel distant and complicated. We make it simple, friendly, and hands-on. Through small-group workshops, we help SHG members learn how to use digital payments safely, how to save and borrow confidently to access government schemes meant for themHow to plan their finances as a group and as This isn’t just about money. It’s about giving women the freedom to make their own decisions, support their families, and dream bigger.




Entrepreneurship- Once the products are ready, the next step is to help women present them proudly. We teach simple branding, packaging, and how to build their own product identity. We take photos, design labels, write stories, and help them sell through various online and offline platforms. We also connect SHGs to corporate partners, schools, and NGOs: making sure their products reach the wider world. This pillar is about more than sales. It’s about women seeing themselves as creators, business owners, and leaders.




Impact wall- will be added later after various impact metrics and targets have been achieved.




Women’s stories- once all women part of the project are finalized, their stories will be collected and uploaded onto the website




Resources have been uploaded to the drive folder.




LOGO OPTIONS-







Colour palette will be selected on the basis of the logo chosen- I believe the first option is a strong preference, but feel free to give your inputs. Once logo is chosen, i will send over the final colour palette as well as the versions of the final logo without a watermark., and must make all page s"Women's stories
